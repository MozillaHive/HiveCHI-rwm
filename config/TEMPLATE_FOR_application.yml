# The following environment variables must be present in application.yml for the
# app to work:

TWILIO_SID:
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN:
TWILIO_ORIGINATING_NUMBER:
GOOGLE_API_KEY: AIzaSyAcZ1NrRFt8hQ9k6fbf-H2VhKDSwlmi-g8 # This is publicly exposed
HOSTNAME: localhost:3000

# The following environment variables don't need to be present, but may be useful:

EMAIL_VERIFICATION: # Set to 'DISABLED' to disable email verification
PHONE_VERIFICATION: # Set to 'DISABLED' to disable phone verification
DISABLE_NUDGE_TEXTS: # Set to 'TRUE' to disable nudges globally
DISABLE_REGISTRATIONS: # Set to 'TRUE' to disable new user registrations
SENDGRID_USERNAME:
SENDGRID_PASSWORD:

# Note: disabling email and phone verification WILL CAUSE SOME SPECS TO FAIL
# because they are written on the assumption that those features are on. If you
# set those variables, comment them out before running the test suite.
