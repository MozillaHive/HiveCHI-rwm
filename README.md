When you begin working on an issue:

1. make sure nobody else is already working on it;
2. assign the issue to yourself;
2. add the In Progress label;
3. create a new branch and name it with the issue number in front of it (eg. 110-css-work).

If you are no longer working on an issue:

1. immediately remove the In Progress label, so that someone else can work on it;
2. if you have partial changes committed and pushed to the branch, add a comment to the issue explaining what's done and what's still missing.

When you complete your work on the issue:

1. commit and push your branch;
2. create a pull request.

When you merge a pull request:

1. remove the In Progress label;
2. close the issue.
