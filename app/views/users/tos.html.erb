    <h4>1. INTRODUCTION TO THE APP AND USERS</h4>
    <p>The App contains the functionality and program referred to as Ride With Me (also identified as &ldquo;RideW/Me&rdquo; or &ldquo;RIDEW/ME&rdquo; on various informational materials and within the application). The App was created under the stewardship of the Mozilla Hive Chicago Learning Network (the &ldquo;Steward&rdquo;). The App is a point-to-point, peer-to-peer transportation solution for youth that provides information about learning opportunities (the &ldquo;Events&rdquo;) for students, with transportation options and mapped routes to reach Events, and the limited ability to connect with other users of the App also attending the Events for the purposes of traveling with them.</p>
    <p>Individuals aged 13 or older may gain access to non-public features of the App by creating an account as either a &ldquo;Student&rdquo; or &ldquo;Service Provider&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>Students can search for Events, access information about Events, store information about their attendance to the event (&ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo;), obtain and store transportation and routing information to reach the Event, and contact other Students with Event information. </p>
    <p>Service Providers are validated individual members of an approved partner organization (&ldquo;Partner Organization&rdquo;) that can search for Events, access information about Events, and contact Students with Event information. Service Providers also have the added ability to create Events and access limited information about Students that have Registered for Events created by the Service Provider.</p>
    <p>Detailed information about Student and Service Provider data submission and access can be found in the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h4>2. INFORMATION NOT SERVICE AGREEMENT</h4>
    <p>You are not forming any legal or binding relationship with other students or with a service provider of learning opportunities when you use the App as a Student, nor are you forming any such relationship with any student when you use the App as a Service Provider. The information on this App, including without limitation, event details and attendance information given by the App based on your selections and usage preferences, and sharing of events or interaction between students, is not a substitute for and does not replace information you may otherwise obtain about the events and/or the Students&rsquo; attendance to such events.
